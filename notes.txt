In next.js, we may create a folder like this -> 'src/app/thisFolder/page.tsx'.
Then, and we may navigate to localhost:3000/thisFolder to see the page.
- Note that the name page.tsx is neccessary (much like index.tsx)

In 'src/app/layout.tsx' we can create layout that will apply to all pages

We may make a custom not found page under 'src/app/' the file name must be not-found.tsx

To custom loading page, we need to create a file call loading.tsx (put in 'src/app/' to make it global)

"use client";
// ! "use client"; is used to declare that this is a client component.
// ! need to be on the top most

For this directory structure, /products/[id] <-- it's important to put id in []

not-found.tsx is one of the specific file names.
This file will be recognised by next.js as a custom page not found file.
Example use, if(!product) notFound(); // 'notFound()' come from -> import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

To export metadata, 
need to create an export function with this specific name `export async function generateMetadata()`

Creating 'a custom loading page' by create 'loading.tsx' under 'src/app/'
